                                                Problem 1: SALES TAXES
                                                
        an application that acts like a user interface and prints out the receipt details for a shopping basket

*********************************************************************************************************************



As soon as you run the application, you are asked for the item that you have bought, the number and price of that item.

Then you will be asked about the item type, i.e. whether it's food, books, or groceries.

Please enter the letter y for yes or n for no.

If the item is one of the above categories, the relevant tax is 0, otherwise, the tax rate is .1

Then you will be asked if your purchased item is imported,
if so, the tax rate is .05

In case the correct input is not entered for the number (integer) or the price (float) of the item, 

there will be an error and you will be asked to enter the information again.

After each item, you will be asked if there are more items in your shopping basket.

If not, your receipt, together with all the details of items, prices, taxes and the whole amount to be paid will be diplayed.

HAVE FUN! :)
